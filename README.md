# evomap - A Toolbox for Dynamic Mapping in Python

`evomap` is a comprehensive Python toolbox for creating, exploring, and analyzing spatial representations ('maps') from complex data, including high-dimensional feature vectors and pairwise relationship matrices. Such spatial representations find frequent applications in Marketing (e.g., market structure or positioning analysis), Network Analysis (e.g., social, economic, bibliographic, or biological networks), Political Science (e.g., ideological scaling), and High-Dimensional Data Analysis.

A key use case of `evomap` is creating such maps from time-evolving data by processing longitudinal sequences of relationship matrices or high-dimensional feature vectors. The resultant maps allow users to track changes in complex systems, such as evolving markets or networks, and visualize their underlying evolution.

`evomap` offers an all-in-one solution by integrating several essential steps into an easy-to-use API, including:

- preprocessing
- mapping (static/dynamic)
- evaluation
- plotting

## Installation

`evomap` is available via <a href='https://pypi.org/project/evomap/'>PyPi</a>. 

To install `evomap` run
```bash
pip install evomap
```

`evomap` requires Python version>=3.9. We recommend using Python within a virtual environment, for instance via conda:
```bash
conda create -n evomap python
conda activate evomap
pip install evomap
```

## Usage

The following tutorials provide a good starting point for using `evomap`.

For a simple introduction to a typical market structure application, see <a href='https://evomap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/car%20application.html'>this example</a>.

If you want to explore more of what evomap has to offer, check out the following examples on:

- <a href='https://evomap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/static%20mapping.html'>Static Mapping</a>
- <a href='https://evomap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dynamic%20mapping.html'>Dynamic Mapping</a>

## Mapping Methods

As of now, `evomap` provides implementations of the following mapping methods:
- MDS (Multidimensional Scaling)
- Sammon Mapping (non-linear MDS)
- t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)

You can apply all methods statically and dynamically. Moreover, `evomap` follows the syntax conventions of `scikit-learn`, such that other 
machine-learning techniques (such as LLE, Isomap, ... ) can easily be integrated. For more background, see <a href = 'https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/manifold.html'> here</a>.
